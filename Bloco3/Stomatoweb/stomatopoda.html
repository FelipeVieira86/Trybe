                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>The Mantis Shrimp lives in warm, shallow water, and typically grows to be between 6 - 12 inches in length.</p>

                <h3>Nuclear bomb of light and beauty.</h3>
                <p>While humans have three types of color-receptive cones, the mantis shrimp has <strong>SIXTEEN</strong> color-receptive cones.</p>

                <h3>Came in like more than a wrecking ball.</h3>
                <p>It has two raptorial appendages on the front of its body that accelerate with the same velocity as a gunshot from a twenty-two caliber rifle, and in less than three-thousandths of a second can strike prey with 1,500 Newtons of force.</p>

                    <h4>Throwing into orbit</h4>
                    <p>To put this in perspective, if human beings could accelerate our arms at 1/10th that speed, we'd be able to throw a baseball into orbit.</p>

                <h3>The fastest hands in the ocean</h3>
                <p>Their limbs move so quickly the water around them <strong>boils</strong> in a process known as <em>syoercavutation</em>. When theses cavitation bubble collapse it produces an <strong>undersea shockwave</strong> that can kill prey even if the mantis shrimp misses its target.</p>

                    <h4>The power in his hands</h4>
                    <p>The force of there collapsing bubbles also produces temperatures in te range of several thousand Kelvins and emitis <strong>tiny bursts of light.</strong> This effect is called <em>sonoluminescence</em>.</p>
