                <img class="habitatpic" src="Mantis_shrimp_front.jpg">
                <p>Mantis shrimp live in burrows where they spend the majority of their time. The two different categories of mantis shrimp – spearing and smashing – favor different locations for burrowing. The spearing species build their habitat in soft sediments and the smashing species make burrows in hard substrata or coral cavities. These two habitats are crucial for their ecology since they use burrows as sites for retreat and as locations for consuming their prey. Burrows and coral cavities are also used as sites for mating and for keeping their eggs safe.Stomatopod body size undergoes periodic growth which necessitates finding a new cavity or burrow that will fit the animal's new diameter. Some spearing species can modify their pre-established habitat if the burrow is made of silt or mud, which can be expanded.</p>

                <p>While humans have three types of color-receptive cones, the mantis shrimp has <strong>SIXTEEN</strong> color-receptive cones.</p>
                <p>Each compound eye is made up of up tens of thousands of ommatidia, clusters of photoreceptor cells. Each eye consists of two flattened hemispheres separated by parallel rows of specialised ommatidia, collectively called the midband. The number of omatidial rows in the midband ranges from two to six. This divides the eye into three regions. This configuration enables mantis shrimp to see objects with three parts of the same eye. In other words, each eye possesses trinocular vision and therefore depth perception. The upper and lower hemispheres are used primarily for recognition of form and motion, like the eyes of many other crustaceans.</p>

                <p>The shrimp mantis has two raptorial appendages on the front of its body that accelerate with the same velocity as a gunshot from a twenty-two caliber rifle, and in less than three-thousandths of a second can strike prey with 1,500 Newtons of force.</p>
                <p>Their limbs move so quickly the water around them <strong>boils</strong> in a process known as <em>syoercavutation</em>. When theses cavitation bubble collapse it produces an <strong>undersea shockwave</strong> that can kill prey even if the mantis shrimp misses its target.</p>
                <p>The mantis shrimp's second pair of thoracic appendages has been adapted for powerful close-range combat with high modifications. The appendage differences divide mantis shrimp into two main types: those that hunt by impaling their prey with spear-like structures and those that smash prey with a powerful blow from a heavily mineralised club-like appendage.</p>

                    <p>To put this in perspective, if human beings could accelerate our arms at 1/10th that speed, we'd be able to throw a baseball into orbit.</p>

                <p>A considerable amount of damage can be inflicted after impact with these robust, hammer-like claws. This club is further divided into three subregions: the impact region, the periodic region, and the striated region. Mantis shrimp are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the type of claws they possess:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smashers possess a much more developed club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to bludgeon and smash their meals apart. The inner aspect of the terminal portion of the appendage can also possess a sharp edge, used to cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims.</li>
                    <li>Spearers are armed with spiny appendages topped with barbed tips, used to stab and snag prey.</li>

                    <p>The force of there collapsing bubbles also produces temperatures in te range of several thousand Kelvins and emitis <strong>tiny bursts of light.</strong> This effect is called <em>sonoluminescence</em>.</p>
