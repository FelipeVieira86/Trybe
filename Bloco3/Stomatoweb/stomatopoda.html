                <img class="habitatpic" src="Mantis_shrimp_front.jpg">
                <p>Mantis shrimp live in burrows where they spend the majority of their time. The two different categories of mantis shrimp – spearing and smashing – favor different locations for burrowing. The spearing species build their habitat in soft sediments and the smashing species make burrows in hard substrata or coral cavities. These two habitats are crucial for their ecology since they use burrows as sites for retreat and as locations for consuming their prey. Burrows and coral cavities are also used as sites for mating and for keeping their eggs safe.Stomatopod body size undergoes periodic growth which necessitates finding a new cavity or burrow that will fit the animal's new diameter. Some spearing species can modify their pre-established habitat if the burrow is made of silt or mud, which can be expanded.</p>

                <p>It has two raptorial appendages on the front of its body that accelerate with the same velocity as a gunshot from a twenty-two caliber rifle, and in less than three-thousandths of a second can strike prey with 1,500 Newtons of force.</p>

                    <h4>Throwing into orbit</h4>
                    <p>To put this in perspective, if human beings could accelerate our arms at 1/10th that speed, we'd be able to throw a baseball into orbit.</p>

                <h3 class="subtitles">The fastest hands in the ocean</h3>
                <p>Their limbs move so quickly the water around them <strong>boils</strong> in a process known as <em>syoercavutation</em>. When theses cavitation bubble collapse it produces an <strong>undersea shockwave</strong> that can kill prey even if the mantis shrimp misses its target.</p>

                    <h4>The power in his hands</h4>
                    <p>The force of there collapsing bubbles also produces temperatures in te range of several thousand Kelvins and emitis <strong>tiny bursts of light.</strong> This effect is called <em>sonoluminescence</em>.</p>
